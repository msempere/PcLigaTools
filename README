Userscripts and Firefox:
------------------------

Greasemonkey is an extension for Mozilla Firefox, an open source Web Browser. Most userscripts are written for Firefox & Greasemonkey (although some work in Opera, Safari and even Internet Explorer).

I will assume you are using Firefox, if not you should install Firefox first.



Other Browsers:
---------------

User scripts can be used in browsers other than Firefox, but the scripting APIs and browser JavaScript support vary.


Warning: Only install Userscripts that you trust.
